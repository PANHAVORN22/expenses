### Project Description: User Management and Expense Tracking System

This project is a web application designed to manage user registration, login, and expense tracking. It is built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, and includes the following key features:

#### Features

1. **User Registration**:
   - A registration form allows users to sign up by providing their email, password, and username.
   - Basic validation checks ensure that all required fields are filled in.

2. **User Login**:
   - Registered users can log in with their username and password.
   - Sessions are used to manage user authentication.

3. **Expense Management**:
   - Logged-in users can add new expenses, including details such as item name, quantity, unit price, and date.
   - The system calculates the total expense based on the quantity and unit price.
   - Users can view a list of all their expenses and use a search feature to filter items.

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on expense records.
   - Users can add new expenses, edit existing records, and delete entries as needed.

5. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions are used to keep users logged in across different pages.
   - A logout option is provided to end the session and redirect users to the login page.

6. **Database Integration**:
   - The application uses a MySQL database named `data` to store user and expense information.
   - Secure data handling practices, such as password hashing and SQL statement preparation, are implemented.

#### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `data`.
   - Import the provided SQL schema to set up the required tables (`users` and `expenses`).

2. **Configuration**:
   - Update the database connection details in the PHP files (host, user, password, database name, and port).

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Place the project files on a server or local development environment (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP).
   - Navigate to the registration or login page to begin using the application.

#### Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database to enhance security.
- Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities.

#### Future Enhancements

- Implement user roles and permissions for more granular access control.
- Add additional validation and error handling.
- Enhance the user interface for a more modern and responsive design.

This project provides a solid foundation for building more complex user management and expense tracking systems, and can be easily extended to include more features and functionalities.
